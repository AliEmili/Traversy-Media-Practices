# webDevelopment Practices
I started my journey of becoming a web developer, so I got  the impression that it can be so helpful to use github in order to manage my exercises. All the codes are learnt from a youtube channel called 'Traversy Media'
<br/>
First Project : it's a simple responsive page I designed using html & Css.
<br/>
Second Project : it's a responsive page with some pictures and the theme is parallax so when you scroll the images you can se different parts of them using html & Css
<br/>
Third Project : it's a responsive grid website using html & css
<br/>
fourth project : it's a simple registration form, it has no backend, only some js codes to check the validation of inputs and showing all the inputs.
<br/>
fifth project : it's the website of Netflix - I've added some lines of codes to make it more responsive. using html & css & javascript, for the functionality.
